Quotes
======

"The willingness to admit ignorance. Modern science is based on the Latin injunction [ignoramus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoramus) -- 'we do not know'. It assumes that we don’t know everything. Even more critically, it accepts that the things we think we know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No concepts, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge." Chap. 15: The Marriage of Science and Empire, [Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.ynharari.com/), [*Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*, Harper Perential, 2018](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/)

"But despite what you may think, good luck is more dangerous than bad luck. Bad luck teaches valuable lessons about patience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lessons, making you think your brilliance will carry you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn, and when it does you will be completely unprepared." **Law 47: Do Not Go Past The Mark You Aimed For; In Victory, Learn When to Stop**, [Robert Greene](https://powerseductionandwar.com/), [*The 48 Laws of Power*, Viking Press, 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power)

"Suffering arises from craving; The only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience the reality as it is." Chap. 12: The Law of Religion, [Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.ynharari.com/), [*Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*, Harper Perential, 2018](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/)

"At times like this, looking back may be tempting, but it’s terribly counterproductive. Don’t bemoan the way things were. They will never be that way again. Pour your energy, every bit of it, into adapting to your new world, into learning the skills you need to prosper in it and into shaping it around you. Whereas the old land presented limited opportunity or none at all, the new land enables you to have a future whose rewards are worth all the risks." [Andy Groove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove), [*Only The Paranoid Survive: How to Exploit the Crisis Points that Challenge Every Company*, Currency, 1999](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/72469/only-the-paranoid-survive-by-andrew-grove/)

"That which does not kill us, makes us stronger," [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://thebestbrainpossible.com/what-doesnt-kill-you-makes-you-stronger/)

"If you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how." [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191843730.001.0001/q-oro-ed5-00007886)

"There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don’t know we don’t know." [Donald Rumsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns)

"Materiam superabat opus -- the workmanship was better than the material: The material we’ve been given genetically, emotionally, financially, that’s where we begin. We don’t control that. We do control what we make of that material, and whether we squander it." [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/), [*Ego is the Enemy*, Partfolio, 2016](http://egoistheenemy.com/)

"The method of Cartesian doubt: Don’t accept anything as true if there is the slightest possibility that it isn’t." [Rene Descartes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/). [Nigel Warburton, *A Little History of Philosophy*, Yale University Press, 2011](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/little-history-of-philosophy-nigel-warburton/1102122082)

"I think, therefore I am" ([cogito ergo sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum)): As long as he was having a thought at all, he, Descartes, must exist. The demon couldn’t make him believe that he existed if he didn't. That is because something that doesnot exist cannot have thoughts. [Nigel Warburton, *A Little History of Philosophy*, Yale University Press, 2011](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/little-history-of-philosophy-nigel-warburton/1102122082)

"We're all gonna die. We don't get much to say over how and when. But we do get to decide how we're gonna live. So do it. Decide. Is this the life you want to live? Is this the best you can be? Can you be stronger? Kinder? More compassionate? Decide. Breathe in. Breathe out. And decide." Lines by Cristina Yang ([Sandra Oh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Oh)) from [Grey’s Anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy), season 10, episode 1.
