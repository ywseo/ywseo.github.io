'My head is bloody, but unbowed.'

Invictus
======

[Invictus](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus), William Ernest Henley

>
> Out of the night that covers me,
>
>    Black as the pit from pole to pole,
>
> I think whatever gods may be
>
>    For my unconquerable soul.
>
>
> In the fell clutch of circumstance
>
>    I have not winced nor cried aloud.
>
> Under the bludgeoning of change
>
>    My head is bloody, but unbowed.
>
>
> Beyond this place of wrath and tears
>
>    Looms but the Horror of the shade,
>
> And yet the menace of the years
>
>    Finds and shall find me unafraid.
>
>
> It matters not how strait the gate,
>
>    How charged with punishments the scroll,
>
> I am the master of my fate,
>
>    I am the captain of my soul.
