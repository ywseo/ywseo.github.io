"If so, the world is getting better at every single day by the fact, not by optimism, why do we feel or think the other way around? Primarily due to our cognitive bias and nature of news.

"...because it's not up to us whether what we do is any good, and if history has taught us anything, the world is an extremely unreliable critic, Right? ...The time of our life is so short, and how we spend it -- are we spending it doing what's important to us? ...You just have to follow your love.

"And once we clued into the fact that life is finite, the thought of losing it didn't scare us anymore. The end comes no matter what. The only thing that matters is how do you want to go out? On your feet or on your knees? I bring that lesson to this job. I act knowing that someday this job will end, no matter what.
