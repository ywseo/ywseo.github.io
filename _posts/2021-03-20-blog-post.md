Some quotes, a collection of wisdom may calm you down and put things in perspective.

"That which does not kill us, makes us stronger." ([What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger](https://thebestbrainpossible.com/what-doesnt-kill-you-makes-you-stronger/)) [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/).

"If you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how." [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191843730.001.0001/q-oro-ed5-00007886).

"There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don’t know we don’t know." [Donald Rumsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns).

"Be [the First Penguin](https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/honor/index.html): Even in dangerous waters, one penguin had to be brave enough to take the first dive,"

"Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted,"

"The key question to ask is are you spending your time on the right things? Because time is all we have." [Randy Pausch](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/).

"Learning and innovation go hand in hand. The arrogance of success is to think what you did yesterday will be sufficient for tomorrow." [William Pollard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pollard).

"Why should we feel anger at the world? As if the world would notice." [Euripides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides).

"Today that you have lived in vain is the tomorrow that a person who died yesterday truly wanted to live." [Sophocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles).

"Remembering our past can be a healthy exercise. We should yet beware of manipulations of our memory. By sticking to things that torment us, we can be tempted to brood over what should have, could have or would have been done. When we walk down the memory lane, we learn from the past and pick for the present the fundamentals, which can be brought into play for the future.” [Erik Pevernagie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Pevernagie).

"[Our ignorance is invisible to us](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/1/31/18200497/dunning-kruger-effect-explained-trump)." [David Dunning](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/ddunning.html) (proposed the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)). So, it's best for us to be [intellectually humble](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/1/4/17989224/intellectual-humility-explained-psychology-replication) as much as we could on what we think we know, and "entertain the possibility that you may be wrong and being open to learning from the experience of others." And keep in mind what the wise such as [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) warned us that "our reality will always be an interpretation" and [naive realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_realism_(psychology)) always deceves us what we see or what we think we saw.

"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman). ([One way we fool ourselves is by imagining we know more than we do; we think we are experts.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-easiest-person-to-fool/id1028908750?i=1000507359305))
