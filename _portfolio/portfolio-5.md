**Analyzing CPU Utilizatioin Patterns to Understand Dynamic Computational Workload of a Self-driving Car** This study aims at developing a method that predicts the CPU usage patterns of software tasks running on a self-driving car. To ensure safety of such dynamic systems, the worst-case-based CPU utilization analysis has been used; however, the nature of dynamically changing driving contexts requires more flexible approach for an efficient computing resource management. To better understand the dynamic CPU usage patterns, this paper presents an effort of designing a feature vector to represent the information of driving environments and of predicting, using regression methods, the selected tasksâ€™ CPU usage patterns given specific driving contexts. Experiments with real-world vehicle data show a promising result and validate the usefulness of the proposed method. Read the following papers to learn more about this work:

**[Tartan Racing](http://www.tartanracing.org/)** [Boss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F._Kettering) is an autonomous vehicle that uses on-board sensors (global positioning system,
lasers, radars, and cameras) to track other vehicles, detect static obstacles, and localize
itself relative to a road model. A three-layer planning system combines mission, behavioral, and motion planning to drive in urban environments. The mission planning layer
considers which street to take to achieve a mission goal. The behavioral layer determines
when to change lanes and precedence at intersections and performs error recovery maneuvers. The motion planning layer selects actions to avoid obstacles while making progress
toward local goals. The system was developed from the ground up to address the require-
ments of the DARPA Urban Challenge using a spiral system development process with
a heavy emphasis on regular, regressive system testing. During the National Qualification Event and the 85km Urban Challenge Final Event, Boss demonstrated some of its capabilities, qualifying first and winning the challenge. Read the following papers to learn more about this work:
