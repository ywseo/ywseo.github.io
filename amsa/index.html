        <h1>Pushing the Envelope to Deliver a SW Stack for Autonomous Mobility by Shared Autonomy</h1>

	<h2>Atlas Robotics, Inc.</h2>
	
	<p>For the past two years from May 2018 to July 2020, I headed
	a startup, Atlas Robotics, Inc., and pushed the envelope to
	deliver a software stack for autonomous mobility by shared
	autonomy. What we meant by ``Autonomous Mobility by Shared
	Autonomy" is a software stack that based on driving context,
	switches its autonomy back and forth between two modes:
	autonomous and remote. The product we call it ``AtLast," will
	enable a self-driving vehicle to autonomously navigate where
	less complex navigation scenarios like driving on a
	predetermined route while occasionally interacting with road
	occupants (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.), and it will let
	a human operator fully or partially take over control of the
	vehicle once its navigation limit is surpassed by the
	complexity of the environment. We were building such a hybrid
	driving system because we strongly believe that the benefits of
	autonomous driving are too substantial and urgent to be
	ignored or delayed and inherent challenges to complete fully
	autonomous driving are too complex to overcome in a couple of
	decades. This is not just our own assessment of the
	development of autonomous driving technology but also the
	  consensus of the community leaders.

	<ul>
	<li>["The technology won't be ubiquitous for decades and that driverless vehicles will always have constraints."](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/waymo-ceo-says-self-driving-cars-won-t-be-ubiqitious-for-decades) John Krafcik, CEO, Waymo, Bloomberg, Nov 13, 2018.
	<li>["This is a change that's going to scale over decades, not over weeks"](https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/aurora-is-not-building-autonomous-cars-its-building-safe-drivers) Chris Urmson, CEO, Aurora, Mar 25, 2019.
	<li>["Nobody is even close" to making a truly self-driving car](https://www.whichcar.com.au/car-news/truly-autonomous-cars-a-pipe-dream-says-toyota) James Kuffner, CEO, Advanced Development Division of TRI, Oct 30, 2019.
	  </ul>

        Our hybrid driving system with human-in-the-loop will be a
	stepping stone before the community appreciates the benefits
	of fully autonomous driving everywhere. The utmost utility of
	our hybrid navigation system becomes apparent in when a remote
	operator can drive more than one robotic vehicle at a
	time. This desideratum requires our system, one that enables
	entities (e.g., autonomous driving SW and human remote
	operator) to seamlessly switch the autonomy of the vehicle
	when necessary. In turn, to support seamless transition, the
	shared autonomy module should reliably execute the following
	tasks: 1) inform when to switch from autonomous navigation to
	remote, 2) dictate, when to transit, what procedures in what
	orders a remote operator follows to gain situational
	awareness, and 3) execute a series of automatic behaviors for
	emergency.
