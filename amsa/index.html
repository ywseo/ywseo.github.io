        <h1>Developing a Technology Stack for Autonomous Mobility by Shared Autonomy</h1>
	<img src="/amsa/fig/atlas-robotics-logo.png" width="200" align="left" />
	
	<p>For the past two years, I ran my own startup, Atlas
	Robotics, Inc., and worked on developing a technology stack
	for autonomous mobility by shared autonomy. What I meant by
	``Autonomous Mobility by Shared Autonomy'' is a technology
	stack that based on driving contexts, automatically and
	seamlessly switches its autonomy back and forth between two
	driving modes: autonomous and remote. The product based on
	this idea, we call it "<b>AtLast</b>" will enable a
	self-driving capable vehicle to autonomously navigate where
	less complex navigation scenarios like driving on a
	predetermined route while occasionally interacting with road
	occupants (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.), and it will let
	a human operator at a remote site fully or partially take over
	control of the vehicle once its navigation limit is surpassed
	by the complexity of the environment. We were building such a
	hybrid driving system because we strongly believe that the
	benefits of autonomous driving are too substantial and urgent
	to be ignored or delayed, and inherent challenges to complete
	fully autonomous driving are too complex to overcome in a
	couple of decades. This is not just our own assessment of the
	development of autonomous driving technology but also the
	consensus of the community
	leaders. (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/waymo-ceo-says-self-driving-cars-won-t-be-ubiqitious-for-decades">"...The
	technology won't be ubiquitous for decades and that driverless
	vehicles will always have constraints..."</a>, John Krafcik,
	CEO, Waymo, Bloomberg, Nov 13,
	2018; <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/aurora-is-not-building-autonomous-cars-its-building-safe-drivers">"...This
	is a change that's going to scale over decades, not over
	weeks..."</a>, Chris Urmson, CEO, Aurora, Mar 25,

        <p>Our hybrid driving system with human-in-the-loop will be a
	stepping stone before the community appreciates the benefits
	of fully autonomous driving everywhere. The utmost utility of
	our hybrid navigation system becomes apparent in when a remote
	operator can drive more than one robotic vehicle at a
	time. This desideratum requires our system, one that enables
	entities (e.g., autonomous driving SW and human remote
	operator) to seamlessly switch the autonomy of the vehicle
	when necessary. In turn, to support seamless transition, the
	shared autonomy module should reliably execute the following
	tasks:
	<ol>
	<li>Inform <b>when to switch</b> from autonomous navigation to
	  remote,
	<li>Dictate, when to transit, <b>what procedures in what
	orders</b> a remote operator follows to gain situational
	awareness, and
	<li>Execute a series of <b>automatic behaviors for
	  emergency</b> when necessary.
	</ol>
	
        The idea of a sliding or shared autonomy within a team of
robots and humans is not new and has been narrowly explored in some
academic institutions in controlled environments
(e.g., <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robot/trestle/">space
assembly</a>, medical robotics) under strong assumptions (e.g.,
communication latency is ignored and a system is assumed to be stopped
in the middle of its operations). However, to the best of our
knowledge, predicting when to transit autonomous operation of a
robotic vehicle to manual operation has not been extensively
investigated, and industrial systems taking advantage of such a hybrid
architecture have not been deployed in the market yet. We believe
that, if our project is successful, the community will acquire away of
knowing when to intervene with autonomous operation. We believe the
impact of this technology will be significant. In fact, this
capability will be a game-changer as it will pave the way for
deploying more robotic systems to the real world where robotic systems
do routine, mundane, repetitive, dangerous tasks, and when help is
needed ask human team mates, who are undoubtedly better in decision
making and perception for most of the cases. There are hard questions
to answer, but this project is a perfect fit to a startup with the
right skillset to move swiftly and efficiently toward validating a
demanding but rewarding R&D proposition.</p>

	<h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
	<p> The target customers are those businesses who need workers
	with specific skillsets. Examples include those providing
	shuttle services, large-scale farming agriculture, premise
	patrol, closed-space transport, and construction
	services. These customers are all suffering a lack of manpower
	and the highest liability insurance premiums. To remedy these
	pains, they all need something that can do what a skillful
	worker can do, without exposing workers to any hazardous
	situations. <b>AtLast</b> can relieve these pains by filling
	the gap of manpower shortages and/or eliminating worker
	exposure to any hazardous work situations. For example, the
	developing system will enable law- and security-enforcing of
	officers to more safely and effectively patrol regions without
	exposing themselves to dangerous situations; a shuttle driver,
	an operator of construction or agricultural equipment does not
	have to be behind the wheel but at a remote station, where
	they could potentially drive more than one vehicle at the same
	time. When something requiring human attention happens, the
	developing algorithm notifies the operators to take over and
	lets what a human does better. In particular, the developing
	algorithm will switch an excavator driven autonomously to a
	construction site to remote when the remotely stationed
	operator needs to carry out precision earth digging. This idea
	can be also easily projected onto closed-space transport
	domains such as shuttle services for silver communities and
	freight delivery for airports where an operator can supervise
	autonomous operations of multiple vehicles.</p>

	<h2>Technology Developed</h2>
	<p> Atlas Robotics, Inc. was established in May 2018
envisioning the development of robots to empower humans. We were a
team of five full-time engineers working at two of offices, Livermore,
CA, and Seoul, Korea. With a seed fund of $1 million, we successfully
developed two navigation systems for autonomous driving and for remote
driving for less than a year. See the following as a list of the
developed technologies. For customer traction, we were in
conversations with a couple of potential customers -- unfortunately
none of these led to anything tangible by the time we decided to pull
the plug. See the followings the technology stacks we developed:

	(Yes,
	yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_culpa">Mea
	Culpa</a>, but was it a flop? Well, it remains to be seen.), I
	won't name names here. But I want to say it clear and loud:
	None of the above mentioned would exist without your
	dedication and hard work.</p>
