I'm Youngwoo Seo. Over the past decades, I was fortunate enough to work with many bright and hardworking people for exciting projects, and have gained expertise on developing cutting-edge, robotic systems (e.g., self-driving cars, drones, etc.) through the combination of hands-on experience and in-depth understanding of robotics. By training I'm a field roboticist and computer scientist. By trade I'm a seasoned manager with experience of managing diverse groups. By nature I'm an explorer.
